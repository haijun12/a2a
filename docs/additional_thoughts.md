Here is what I think:
1. Alarm spikes, generates plan using LlamaIndex, based on SOP (think about how the SOP should look like. it should have something like contact numbers, actionable steps such as ordering ice)
2. A potential workflow could be the vaccines on a truck are 3 hours away from deterioating non-recoverably(maybe a certain temp), and the next stop is 2 hours away. in this case, the sop should be something like order ice to that location from a nearby warehouse immediately.
3. call relevant contact and sends sms messages with actionable plans. reply yes to execute (how should we mitigate bad suggestions?)
4. suggest anything else that is feasible (resonable according to real life cold chain procedures) 

Let's dig into the visualization sides more. Some key components we have to show are:
1. A world view that shows were different cargos are at in the world and help stations, and time it takes for time sensitive supplies like ice to arrive at the cargo's next stop.
2. Once a dot goes red, user should be able to click on to it, which redirects to the agent page, which shows an interactive progress/audit log of agent planning. e.g. gathering context (location, temperature, nearby solution availability), reading SOP,  generating actionable solutions, sending report to stakeholder, calling stakeholder, etc.

| **3 Plan generation** | prompt template: <br>“Pallet {id} at {temp} °C, {minutes} min left. Next stop {city} in {eta} min. Use SOP & depot table. Return *‘CALL {phone} MESSAGE {sms_text}’* and *‘EMAIL {address} {body}’*” | Only return JSON with `voice`, `sms`, `email`, `failsafe` |
| **4 Execution** | (a) Vapi voice call → `voice.text`  <br>(b) Twilio SMS → `sms.text`  <br>(c) Arcade Gmail → `email.body` | We removed Slack; actions fire immediately. |
| **5 Mitigation of bad plans** | Failsafe rules inside Guardian before calling:<br>• **Distance check** depot.lead_minutes ≤ minutes_to_failure – safety-buffer<br>• **Whitelist SOP actions** (dry-ice, reroute, speed-up) <br>• If fails → escalate to human hotline | Adds defence against hallucinations. |

#### 1 **World View** (home)

| Section | UI element | Details |
|---------|------------|---------|
| Map | Leaflet / Mapbox canvas (full-width) | Marker color: green (ok), yellow (eta < 3 h), red (alert). Depot markers = blue squares. |
| Hover card | `Tooltip` | Shipment ID, °C, ETA to next stop, minutes to failure (progress ring). |
| Side panel | Alert summary list | Click row → deep-link `/agent/{alert_id}` |

##### *Extra context overlay*  
*When marker selected*: dotted polyline to next stop, dashed line to chosen ice depot, plus label “Ice van ETA: 56 min”.

#### 2 **Agent Page** (`/agent/:id`)

| Pane | Component | UX cue |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Left 65 % | **Progress Timeline** (vertical) | Steps appear with check-icon animate: <br>① Ingest alert → ② Gather context → ③ Query SOP → ④ Evaluate options → ⑤ Execute calls / e-mails |
| Right 35 % | **Live transcript / log** | Collapsible sections showing:<br>• JSON alert payload<br>• Llama prompt & answer<br>• Voice script & SMS preview |
| Footer | **Audit actions** | Download PDF; Copy incident JSON |

#### 3 **Audit Log** (global)

*Table of incidents*: ID · date · product type · outcome (saved / destroyed) · $ saved (computed).

### C.  Key happy-path demo on UI

| t (s) | Visual / Audio |
|-------|----------------|
| 0–10 | World Map: Fresno pallet turns **red**; badge “180 min until spoilage”. Depot icons activate. |
| 10–20 | Auto-transition to Agent Page (or click). Timeline animates through steps; *Voice call plays over mic*. |
| 20–25 | Log pane highlights “ORDER ICE from Fresno DC (ETA 60 min)”. |
| 25–40 | Map shows dashed route from depot to truck; minutes-to-failure badge counts down slower than ETA (visual proof fix will beat spoilage). |
| 40–60 | Operator clicks **Download Audit PDF**; file opens, shows full chain. |

### D.  Actionable build steps for Bolt / UI

1. **Add `lead_minutes` field** to mock depot JSON for ETA logic.  
2. **Guardian calculates** `if minutes_to_failure - safety_buffer < depot.lead_minutes` → fallback to `failsafe:"MANUAL ESCALATION"`.  
3. **WorldView component** (v0 prompt) needs:  
   ```ts
   type Shipment = { id:number, lat:number, lon:number, temp:number, minsLeft:number, nextStop:{lat,lon,eta:number} , depot?:{lat,lon,lead:number} }
And dotted polylines with react-leaflet Polyline.

AgentTimeline:

Feed from SSE events alert, plan, executed.

Each step fades in using framer-motion.

Voice & SMS previews: inline Accordion showing the exact payload your backend sent (makes AI explainable).

E. Future-scope ideas (list one slide)
Predictive mode: fuse weather API → pre-cool pallet on hot routes.

Energy optimisation: Guardian suggests compressor duty-cycle tweaks when ambient < 0 °C.

Continuous learning: feedback loop: if operator edits plan in UI, feed into next LLM fine-tune.

Use this architecture + UX blueprint as direct input for:

Bolt prompt (repo & API shape already given).

v0 prompts – generate WorldView & AgentTimeline components.

Llama SOP index – store YAML-front-matter docs under /data/sop_mrna_v1.md.

This gets rid of Slack friction, adds meaningful logistics logic (ETA vs spoilage), and keeps the visual story crisp for judges.
